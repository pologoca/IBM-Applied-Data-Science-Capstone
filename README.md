# Applied Data Science Capstone Project
## Background
This Capstone is the 10th (final) course in IBM Data Science Professional Certificate specialization.
SpaceX is the most successful company of the commercial space age, making space travel affordable, with a cost of 62 million dollars, compared to other providers' costs upwards of 165 million dollars. This saving is because SpaceX's reuses the first stage of the rocket. The project’s goal is to predict the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage to better estimate the launch costs.
## Questions
•	How do variables such as pay load mass, launch site, number of flights, and orbits affect the success of the first stage landing?

•	Does the rate of successful landings increase with the number of launches?

•	What is the best model to predict the first stage landin?

## Modules
### 1. SpaceX data collection
•	Request to the SpaceX API to gather historical launch data.
### 2. Web Scraping Falcon 9 Launch Records
•	Extracted Falcon 9 launch records from Wikipedia using BeautifulSoup.
### 3. Data wrangling
•	Data was cleaning and formatting, removing anomalies or missing values, to ensure consistency and preparing it for analysis.
### 4. EDA (data visualizations)
•	 Tables and graphs were obtained using visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
### 5. EDA (with SQL)
•	A dataset was loaded into a Db2 database to perform SQL queries to obtain information related to the launch data.
### 6. Map for launch site locations
•	Interactive maps was displayed using folium, to identify geographical patterns related to launch sites.
### 7. Interactive dashboard
•	Interactive application was constructed using Plotly and Dash, to perform real-time visual analytics on the SpaceX launch data.
### 8. Machine learning prediction 
•	Building, tuning and evaluation was carried out on classification models (Logistic regression, SVM, Classification tres and KNN).
