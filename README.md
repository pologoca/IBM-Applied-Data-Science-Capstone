# Applied Data Science Capstone Project
## Overview
Welcome to the Applied Data Science Capstone Project, where we embark on a journey to predict the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage. SpaceX, known for revolutionizing space travel, advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches at a competitive cost of 62 million dollars, compared to other providers' costs upwards of 165 million dollars. This significant cost-saving is largely attributed to SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage of the rocket. By accurately predicting the landing success of the first stage, we can better estimate the launch costs, providing valuable insights for companies bidding against SpaceX for rocket launches.
